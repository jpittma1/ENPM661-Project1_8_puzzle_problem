ENPM 661: Planning for Autonomous Robots Spring 2022.
Project 1 - 8 PUZZLE PROBLEM

Solving an 8-Puzzle problem for Introduction to Planning for Autonomous Robots using Breadth First Search

Instructions to run the Code

File Name : proj1_jerry_pittman.py

Recommended IDE: VSC 

Version of python : Python 3

Libraries imported : numpy; timeit; copy

Running Instructions:
Prep: Goal State can be edited on line 23; Initial state is user inputted
1) Run code. 
2) User inputs initial state matrix (3x3).
3) Program compares initial state to goal state and solves using breadth first search (lists as data structure) and using queue functionality.

Solution path is printed on screen and outputted into:
1) "nodePath.txt" for showing each state from start node to goal node
2) "nodesInfo.txt" for showing all nodes' index and parent node index in columns
3)"Nodes.txt" all nodes explored/visited
